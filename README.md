# 👋 Hi, I'm Ethan!

I'm an AI Developer at Lava Studios, passionate about building powerful tools that blend generative AI, cloud infrastructure, and real-world usefulness. I transitioned into tech from the machining world, and now I’m focused on turning creative ideas into working software.

## 💼 What I Do

- 🧠 **AI & ML** — Integrating generative AI (OpenAI, Leonardo, Luma, etc.) into real apps.
- ☁️ **Cloud** — Building and deploying backend systems using **Firebase**, **GCP**, and **AWS**.
- 💻 **Frontend** — Working with **FlutterFlow** to create user-friendly UIs (still leveling up here).
- 🛠️ **Python Dev** — Flask APIs, Firestore integrations, logging, and automation.
